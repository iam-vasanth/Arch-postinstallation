1. Setting everything up

setfont ter-120b														# sets the font to readable size

Connect to internet:													# ethernet will directly get recognized. The below steps are for wifi.
iwctl
device list
station [selected station] get-networks
station [selected station] connect [network-name]						# if the networks has space in-between or a special character. Keep it inside a single or double quotes and try executing above command
ping -c 5 archlinux.org													# to check the network connectivity

	Optional:
	1. Do these on target PC
	passwd																# sets a temp password for arch live boot
	vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config											# confirm that "PermitRootLogin yes" is set
	systemctl start sshd
	systemctl enable sshd
	ip a																# note down the ip address of the device

	2.Do these on local machine
	ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null root@ip.address.of.target	# replace "ip.address.of.target" with the ip address of target machine

cat /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size

Output:
64 - 64bit UEFI
32 - 32bit UEFI
No such file or directory - either it's BIOS or CSM

timedatectl set-ntp true

2. Partitioning the disks

lsblk
fdisk /dev/[disk name]													# if you're on a BIOS system - MBR partiotion table (Recommended for older system which does not have UEFI)
gdisk /dev/[disk name]                                                  # if you're on a EFI system - GPT partition table (Recommended if your PC is UEFI based and you are dual booting)
cfdisk /dev/[disk name]													
x																		# Expert command
z																		# "Zap" the disk
y																		# Blank our MBR

gdisk /dev/[disk name]
n												# new partition
nth Partition: <press Enter>
nth sector: <press Enter>
+1G												# boot partition size
EF00											# indicates this is a EFI system partition

	Optional:										# Swap partition
	n
	nth Partition: <press Enter>
	nth sector: <press Enter>
	+16G											# swap partition size
	8200											# indicates this is a swap partition


n												# new partition
nth Partition: <press Enter>
nth sector: <press Enter>
+50G											# root partition size
8300											# indicates this is a linux file system

n												# new partition
1st Partition: <press Enter>
First sector: <press Enter>
Last sector: <press Enter>						# use all the remaining space
8300											# indicates this is a linux file system

w												# write and exit

# making file system and formating the partitions
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/[EFI partition disk name]
mkfs.ext4 /dev/[Root partition disk name]
mkfs.ext4 /dev/[Home partition disk name]

# mounting the file system
mount /dev/[partition] /mnt
mount --mkdir /dev/[partition] /mnt/boot
mount --mkdir /dev/[partition] /mnt/home

3. Installing the system and setting up



pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux linux-headers linux-lts linux-lts-headers linux-firmware neovim amd-ucode
# mtools and dosfstools are needed if dual booting with windows

genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab				# generate a fstab file
cat /mnt/etc/fstab								# check if the file if wanted

arch-chroot /mnt								# chroot into the system

ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Kolkata /etc/localtime		# set the timezone
hwclock --systohc											# sync hardware clock with system time

# set language
nvim /etc/locale.gen										# uncomment the language you want. if english the primary language. uncomment this like "en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8" 
locale-gen													# generate locale
echo 'LANG=en_US.UTF-8' >> /etc/locale.conf					# add language to locale.conf
